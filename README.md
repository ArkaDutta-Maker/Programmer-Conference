# Programmer Conference

Used flask to build this project for my GDSC JU Dev submission

## How to view my project

### For people who just want to see the end website:-

Go to my deployed website at <https://programmer-conference.vercel.app/> which is deployed using vercel.

### For people who want to see the code and run it on their local machine:-

Download my project from github and open app.py which is in the root folder<br>
At the end of app.py uncomment these lines:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
  app.run(debug=True)
```

run the app.py file <br>
or, open commmand prompt on root directory and enter

```
flask run
```
